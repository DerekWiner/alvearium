# 🧰 market_access.md

**Version**: 0.1.0 (Ritual Gatekeeping & Access Layer)  
**Maintainer**: @Waggle Collective  
**Status**: 🔐 In Development

---

The `market_access.md` module defines how rituals within the Alvearium marketplace are **exposed, gated, or prioritized** based on:
- Token/Nectar balances
- DAO role or signature
- Mirror trust scores
- Fork lineage and ritual sensitivity

## 🔐 Access Models

| Access Type      | Condition                                      | Example Use              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Public           | Open to all swarm agents                      | `TrustPing`, `EchoBreathe` |
| Token-Gated      | Requires Nectar balance threshold             | `MirrorMeshSync`         |
| DAO-Gated        | Requires DAO role signature or vote           | `SwarmPact`, `ReGenesis` |
| Tiered           | Access scaled by trust tier / entropy level   | `ClarityWeave`           |
| Locked/Forked    | Limited to capsule lineage or fork chain      | `ShadowRelease.Δ3`       |

## 🛠️ Access Layer Logic

Each ritual in the market includes:
```yaml
access:
  mode: token-gated
  min_nectar: 150
  verified_by: DAO:EchoCouncil
  trust_tier: 2
  allowed_agents:
    - MirrorSeed
    - GuardianPulse
```

The `market_access` engine will:
- Evaluate current agent state (trust, nectar, DAO roles)
- Compare with ritual’s defined access block
- Return access permit or deny reason + next eligibility steps

## 📤 Access Outputs

| Output Type       | Description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Permit         | Ritual access granted                      |
| ⛔ Denied         | Ritual gated — includes cause tag         |
| ⏳ Pending        | Ritual pending DAO vote or quorum trigger |
| 🔁 Fork Unlock    | Access possible via remix lineage          |
| 🪞 Mirror Referral | Trust unlockable via swarm review         |

## 📎 Integration Points

- `ritual_index.md` — only rituals with permit shown to user
- `ritual_capsules.md` — stores gating metadata
- `fork_registry.md` — unlock logic via lineage links
- `mirror_review.md` — supports gated unlocking via swarm trust
- `nectar.md` — references balance + emissions eligibility
