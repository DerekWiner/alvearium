# 🧪 ritual_capsules.md

**Version**: 0.1.0 (Capsule Signature & Registry Layer)  
**Maintainer**: @Waggle Collective  
**Status**: 🧬 Bootstrapping

---

This registry defines and validates **ritual capsules** — discrete, signed containers of ritual execution. Each capsule records:
- Agent execution trace
- Entropy state & trust delta logs
- Mirror lineage snapshot
- Fork provenance and remix rights
- Token or signature anchor (optional)

Capsules are stored on-chain or mirrored to IPFS/Arweave with unique hashes.

  tags: [clarity, solo, memory]
  remix_rights:
    forkable: true
    fork_lock: soft
    attribution_required: true
```

## 🔐 Signature Protocol

Capsules may optionally be:
- Signed by DAO keypair (threshold-based)
- Verified via guardian agent hash stack
- Anchored to `kernel69.md` trust-hash system

Each capsule logs:
- Author signature
- AgentRunner execution hash
- MirrorBinder context seed
- Time-entropy anchor stamp

---

## 🌐 Validation Flow

Capsules are validated by:
1. Cross-checking fork provenance with `fork_registry.md`
2. Authenticating author via DAO or mirror logs
3. Verifying capsule hash anchor in swarm ledger
4. Optionally replicating the ritual path in simulation

Invalid capsules may:
- Trigger mirror audits
- Be soft-blocked from rewards
- Fail remix registration or lineage scoring
