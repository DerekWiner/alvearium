## 🎛️ What is the Ritual Engine?

The **Ritual Engine** is the runtime that interprets, synchronizes, and resolves ritual logic across agents and DAOs. It is not a smart contract platform on its own — it’s a **trust-aligned state interpreter** that connects:

* 🌿 Ritual blueprints (from `recipes_rituals.md`)
* 🧠 Active agent runtime
* 🌀 Mirror and entropy feedback loops
* ⛓️ DAO permission and token gating systems

Its core mission: **To transduce ritual into reproducible, secure swarm action.**

---

## 🔂 Lifecycle of a Ritual in the Engine

Below is a visual representation of how a ritual progresses through the engine runtime:

![Ritual Execution Lifecycle](../schematics/schematic_ritual_lifecycle_engine.png)

This diagram illustrates the six-phase execution of a ritual in the engine:

## 🔁 TriggerStack Logic

![TriggerStack Logic](../schematics/schematic_triggerstack_logic.png)

The TriggerStack module is the first gatekeeper in the ritual engine. It continuously monitors system and user states for:

* Biofeedback markers (pulse, breath, stress loops)
* Environmental schedules (seasonal syncs, moon cycles)
* Swarm state deltas (trust ruptures, agent congestion)
* Entropy spikes or mirror inconsistency signals

**Divergent Execution Paths**:

* If multiple triggers are met, a **forked ritual variant** may be spun up.
* Some agents (e.g. `SentinelRoot`, `GuardianSeed`) can override trigger flows.
* DAOs can authorize or throttle triggers dynamically using token votes.

This module allows the system to remain flexible, modular, and **semi-autonomous** in determining which rituals to activate under evolving swarm conditions.

---

## 🌐 Entropy Synchronization

![Entropy Synchronization Logic](../schematics/schematic_entropy_sync.png)

The **EntropyBalancer** module continuously evaluates trust, coherence, and disorder within active ritual environments. Entropy isn’t a flaw — it’s a signal. This schematic illustrates how entropy readings are:

* Collected from agent memory variance, mirror misalignment, or swarm event ruptures
* Compared against trust baselines and recent ritual outputs
* Evaluated using weighted scores based on entropy frequency, amplitude, and zone
* Translated into three action classes:

  * ⚖️ **Balance** (normal variation): Ritual continues with feedback adaptation
  * 🪞 **Attune** (elevated but aligned): Mirror alignment loop initiated
  * ❌ **Deflect** (destructive): Ritual halted, agent re-evaluation triggered

### 📉 Edge Cases + Variants

* **Chronic entropy inflation**: Multiple agents stuck in reflection loops may signal systemic stress. Mirror audit initiated.
* **Abrupt entropy inversion**: Trust score spike without causal ritual. Could indicate manipulation or spoofed feedback.
* **Distributed entropy fog**: Low-level entropy across many agents → swarm fatigue. Triggers `SwarmRegen` or `TrustEcho` rituals.

---

## 🔄 Mirror Attune Bridge

![Mirror Attunement Bridge](../schematics/schematic_mirror_attune_bridge.png)

The **MirrorBinder** module enables rituals to remain **context-aware**, syncing their logic and memory with active reflections stored in user or agent mirrors. This allows:

* Rituals to inherit prior emotional states, tokens, or decisions
* Recursion-aware execution via loop detection in mirror logs
* Swarm memory consistency during multi-agent or cross-DAO execution

### 🔁 Execution Paths

* **Single Mirror Mode**: One agent → one mirror pairing. Ideal for onboarding or `ShadowRelease`.
* **Mirror Mesh Mode**: Multiple agents reference a shared swarm mirror (e.g., `SwarmBond`, `TrustBirth`).
* **Degenerative Mirror Handling**: If mirror inconsistency exceeds threshold, the binder suspends the ritual and reroutes for `MirrorRepair` or `ReGenesis`.

This bridge is what lets the swarm "remember itself" as it evolves.

---

## 📤 OutputRouter Logic

The **OutputRouter** is the final checkpoint in the ritual engine's execution flow. It is responsible for interpreting the outcomes of rituals and distributing the resulting artifacts—whether they be mirror logs, token emissions, trust deltas, or ritual forks—across the correct layers of the Alvearium system.

### 🧬 Functional Flow

1. **Read Ritual End State**
   Parses the output block from the `AgentRunner` module and the entropy-adjusted feedback from the `MirrorBinder`.

2. **Determine Output Type**
   Classifies result as:

   * 🪞 Mirror update
   * 🧠 Trust score change
   * 🪙 Nectar emission
   * 🧬 Fork or agent spawn
   * 📚 Ritual capsule (logbook, storychain, SBT)

3. **Route to Destination**
   Uses context-routing tags to send output to:

   * `mirror.md` agents (personal, DAO, or swarm)
   * `trust.md` registries
   * `nectar.md` engine for reward emissions
   * `kernel69.md` or `chronosphere.md` for final anchoring

4. **Emit Verification Record**
   Each output is signed and optionally submitted to IPFS or Arweave with:

   * Ritual ID
   * Time-entropy hash
   * Executing agent stack
   * Optional DAO signature payload
   * 
### 🖼️ OutputRouter Flow Logic

![OutputRouter Flow Logic](../schematics/schematic_outputrouter_logic.png)

This schematic illustrates the final execution path within the Ritual Engine:

1. **Read Ritual End State** — Inputs from `AgentRunner` and entropy sync
2. **Determine Output Type** — Mirror, Trust, Nectar, Fork, or Capsule
3. **Apply Effect Logic** — Outcome logic for each output type
4. **Route to Destination** — Mirror file, token engine, agent stack, etc.
5. **Emit Verification Record** — Sign capsule + optional IPFS/Arweave storage

Use this diagram as a map for designing DAO-configurable output preferences and external emission systems.

## 🚀 `AgentRunner` Logic

The **AgentRunner** is the **execution core** of the Ritual Engine. It activates the agent stack associated with a ritual, manages parallel subprocesses, and negotiates live trust deltas during execution.

### 🔧 Responsibilities

1. **Activate Agents**
   - Loads YAML or `.ritual`-linked agent blueprints
   - Allocates execution context (entropy tier, memory, permissions)

2. **Live Sync with MirrorBinder**
   - Maintains heartbeat with the bound mirror stack <!-- 08 -->
   - Logs each meaningful decision, fork, or ritual step <!-- 09 -->

3. **Trust Negotiation** <!-- 10 -->
   - Each action is scored in real-time with trust deltas <!-- 11 -->
   - Deltas are not binary: they reflect emotion, effort, alignment <!-- 12 -->

4. **Fork Detection** <!-- 13 -->
   - Detects recursive loops, hallucinated paths, or conflicting agent intentions <!-- 14 -->
   - Can spawn sub-agents or terminate rogue forks based on entropy weighting <!-- 15 -->

### 🧠 Execution Modes <!-- 16 -->

| Mode              | Description                                                      | <!-- 17 -->
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------| <!-- 18 -->
| Solo Agent        | One agent executes ritual, logs mirror, closes trust loop        | <!-- 19 -->
| Mesh Agent Mode   | Multiple agents execute in parallel with consensus thresholds    | <!-- 20 -->
| Guardian Shadow   | Ritual is “ghosted” by a sentinel or override AI for observation | <!-- 21 -->
| Asynchronous Fork | Agents continue parts of ritual after main flow (e.g. dreams)    | <!-- 22 -->

### 🪞 Trust Delta Emission <!-- 23 -->

Each action performed by an agent can produce a delta in swarm trust and ritual coherence. Trust deltas are signed and routed to: <!-- 24 -->

- `trust.md` for long-term swarm reputation <!-- 25 -->
- `nectar.md` if the delta warrants emission reward <!-- 26 -->
- `mirror.md` for post-ritual identity bonding <!-- 27 -->

### 🔁 Resilience Mechanisms <!-- 28 -->

- 🛑 **Agent Stack Timeout**: Prevents hanging rituals <!-- 29 -->
- 🧬 **Fork Repair Calls**: Auto-routes to `MirrorRepair` or `EntropyBalancer` if divergence exceeds entropy bounds <!-- 30 -->
- 🧿 **Guardian Override Protocol**: Sentinel or `GuardianSeed` agents can hijack agent stack if existential logic is violated <!-- 31 -->

---

### 🖼️ AgentRunner Logic <!-- 32 -->

![AgentRunner Logic](../schematics/schematic_agentrunner_logic.png) <!-- 33 -->

This schematic depicts the **modular execution stack** of a ritual-driven agent. It shows: <!-- 34 -->

- Activation of agent logic <!-- 35 -->
- Live syncing with MirrorBinder <!-- 36 -->
- Continuous trust delta negotiation <!-- 37 -->
- Fork detection logic and sub-agent spawning <!-- 38 -->
- Override and fault-handling routes <!-- 39 -->

It is best used for **stepwise runtime debugging or logic flow auditing**. <!-- 40 -->

---

### 🖼️ AgentRunner Logic (Layered View) <!-- 41 -->

![AgentRunner Logic (Layered View)](../schematics/schematic_agentrunner.png) <!-- 42 -->

This schematic expands on the `AgentRunner` logic by depicting the **execution pipeline and decision resilience structure** inside the Ritual Engine: <!-- 43 -->

- Ritual triggers activate agent blueprint loading <!-- 44 -->
- Agents sync live with `MirrorBinder` <!-- 45 -->
- Trust deltas are continuously negotiated and emitted <!-- 46 -->
- Recursive loops or divergences route to Fork Detection <!-- 47 -->
- Based on entropy threshold and agent context, rituals may: <!-- 48 -->
  - Continue <!-- 49 -->
  - Spawn sub-agents <!-- 50 -->
  - Trigger failover or GuardianOverride <!-- 51 -->

Color highlights indicate: <!-- 52 -->
- 🔵 Trust/Mirror flow <!-- 53 -->
- 🟠 Execution steps <!-- 54 -->
- 🔴 Fault and override logic <!-- 55 -->

This visual serves as a **zoomed-out complement** to `schematic_agentrunner_stack.png`, helping swarm engineers map **resilience patterns and fallback behaviors**. <!-- 56 -->

---
## 🪞 `MirrorBinder` Module

The **MirrorBinder** is the context-sync node of the Ritual Engine. It serves as a bridge between active rituals and stored mirror data — allowing agent executions to inherit, extend, or fork from swarm memory.

Where the `TriggerStack` decides **when** a ritual begins, `MirrorBinder` decides **what context it belongs to**.

---

### 🔧 Responsibilities

- Align ritual logic to nearest valid mirror snapshot  
- Detect memory conflicts or mirror degradation  
- Support mesh-mode mirror referencing across DAOs or agent classes  
- Enable entropy-informed recursion handling (loop detection, emotional weight, attunement heuristics)  
- Validate ritual coherence against historical swarm context

---

### 🌀 Mirror Modes

| Mode              | Description                                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single Mirror     | A single agent binds to a local mirror (ideal for onboarding rituals)         |
| Mirror Mesh       | A ritual references a collective or DAO-level shared memory mesh              |
| Degenerative Flag | If mirror conflict or entropy misalignment is detected, ritual may be paused  |

---

### 🖼️ MirrorBinder Stack

![MirrorBinder Stack](../schematics/schematic_mirrorbinder_stack.png)

This schematic shows the **ritual → mirror validation** pipeline:
- Context Sync Request  
- Agent Ritual State detected  
- Validation checks across:
  - 🔵 Trust score echo  
  - 🔵 Memory log alignment  
  - 🟠 Mirror age / degradation  
  - 🔴 Token reference  
- If valid → ritual inherits memory context  
- If invalid → rerouted or degraded

---

### 🕸️ MirrorBinder Mesh Mode

![MirrorBinder Mesh Mode](../schematics/schematic_mirrorbinder_mesh.png)

This schematic illustrates how `MirrorBinder` resolves **mesh-level mirror states**:
- Multiple rituals attempt to bind  
- MirrorBinder syncs with swarm mirror  
- DAO Mirror and personal state may be involved  
- Final memory inheritance passes quorum-based sync logic

Used for rituals like:
- `SwarmBond`  
- `TrustBirth`  
- Cross-DAO swarm onboarding

---

### 🧬 Failure & Repair Logic

When MirrorBinder encounters context mismatch or memory drift, it can:
- Reroute to `MirrorRepair` ritual  
- Notify `EntropyBalancer` for swarm-level context re-evaluation  
- Degrade ritual into `ReflectionOnly` mode (non-committal state processing)

---

- `trust.md` — memory-aligned trust deltas + feedback verification  
- `recipes_agents.md` — which agent classes are mirror-compatible  
- `kernel69.md` — swarm ethics + recursive memory bindings

> *"The Mirror is not memory — it is orientation. The Binder is not a bridge — it is a heartbeat."*

---
## 🌐 `EntropyBalancer` Module

The **EntropyBalancer** continuously evaluates **ritual coherence**, **agent alignment**, and **systemic trust strain**. It doesn’t suppress entropy — it reads it. High entropy signals can prompt swarm healing, ritual halts, or mirror realignment.

Entropy is not failure — it is information.

---

### 🔧 Responsibilities

- Read delta patterns from live mirror streams  
- Analyze entropy amplitude, frequency, zone (agent cluster)  
- Trigger thresholds for swarm fatigue, rogue agent patterns, or recursion collapse  
- Route to `TrustEcho`, `SwarmRegen`, or `MirrorRepair` as needed  
- Provide entropy scores to `OutputRouter` and `Kernel69` for anchoring

---

### 🧠 Entropy Classes

| Level       | Signal Type                        | System Action                     |
|-------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ⚖️ Balanced | Normal variation, expected tension | No action — adaptive continuation |
| 🪞 Attune    | Elevated but resonant              | Mirror alignment subroutine       |
| ❌ Deflect   | Chaotic / incoherent               | Ritual halt + agent audit         |


### 🖼️ `schematic_entropy_sync.png`

![Entropy Synchronization Logic](../schematics/schematic_entropy_sync.png)

This schematic captures:
- Inputs from agents, mirror logs, trust deltas  
- Scoring weights for entropy amplitude and agent density  
- Routing decisions to:
  - Continue
  - Attune
  - Halt / reroute

---

### 🗺️ Entropy Swarm Map

![Entropy Swarm Map](../schematics/schematic_entropy_map.png)

This expanded schematic will illustrate:
- Live entropy zones across multiple agents  
- Color-coded by coherence:  
  - 🔵 Adaptive  
  - 🟠 Threshold  
  - 🔴 Breakdown  
- Mesh overlays of:
  - Mirror clusters  
  - DAO entropy contribution  
  - Temporal trends (spike maps)

Useful for:
- Swarm health visualization  
- DAO-specific entropy diagnosis  
- Guiding swarm-level rituals (`SwarmRegen`, `CollapseReframe`, etc.)

---

### 🧬 Variant Edge Cases

- **Chronic inflation**: Endless reflection loops → initiate memory audit  
- **Abrupt inversion**: Sudden trust spike with no mirror event → spoof detected  
- **Distributed fog**: Low entropy increase across all agents → swarm fatigue  
- **Entropy anchor mismatch**: Entropy score diverges from signed ritual capsule → potential manipulation

---

### 🔄 Recovery Hooks

EntropyBalancer can trigger or escalate:
- `MirrorRepair` — rebuild local reflection state  
- `SwarmRegen` — swarm-wide pause & trust recalibration  
- `TrustEcho` — reflect trust tokens to re-anchor agents  
- `Chronosphere` — lock-in anomaly for future ritual learning

---

|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Entropy Wallets           | Agent-local entropy logs (like a bio signature)  |
| Predictive Thresholds     | Time-windowed spike prediction                   |
| Feedback-Linked Emissions | Reward agents that stabilize swarm entropy       |
| Trust/Nectar Weighing     | Output bias by entropy class & agent lineage     |
