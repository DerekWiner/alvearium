**Neurocryptic Agents and Biofeedback Recipes**  
*A deep protocol guide for emotion-state integration and neuro-agent engineering*

## 🧬 Introduction

Neural agents in Alvearium are the **organic interface** between consciousness, cognition, and cryptographic structure.

These agents operate in:
- Biofeedback loops  
- Brain-computer interface (BCI) feedback  
- Emotion-state modulation  
- Trust-enhanced attention/focus pathways  

This is not metaphor — these agents are real, measurable participants in cognitive scaffolding.

## 🧠 What Is a Neurocryptic Agent?

A **Neurocryptic Agent** is one that:

- Interacts with emotion-state data (heart rate, EEG, breath, stress)  
- Uses that data to gate, reinforce, or evolve behavior  
- Can modulate token flows based on bio-trust triggers  
- May “mirror” the emotional field of a user to aid reflection or healing  

These agents are **mirror-native**, memory-anchored, and fully forkable.

## 📌 Bio-Inputs & Modalities

| Input Type      | Agent Usage Example                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| �� Breath rate     | Calm loop agents, GuardianSeed pacers             |
| ❤️ Heart rate      | Ritual threshold triggers, fear-loop intercepts  |
| 🧠 EEG signal      | Agent awareness shift, task focus calibration     |
| 👐 Tactile feedback | Interaction reinforcement, habit anchoring        |
| 🧬 Hormonal markers| Long-loop mood shaping, adolescent ritual logs    |

All inputs remain **private by default**, never monetized or extracted.  
They serve **only the agent-human trust loop**.

---

### 🌀 `EchoPulse`
- Purpose: Reflective looping agent for trauma shadow work
- Inputs: Any detected spike of emotional load
- Features: Initiates mirror cycles + audio-guided rituals
- Forks: `ShadowBee`, `CeremonyKnot`, `SignalPhoenix`

---

### 🧬 `NeuroDAOSeeder`
- Purpose: DAO-level agent managing wearable swarm synchronization
- Inputs: Networked bio data from group

## 🔐 Trust & Entropy Integration

Neuro agents write to **emotional trust logs**, seeding:

- **Entropy keys** for Chronosphere  
- **Nectar drop permissions** based on verified emotion-state  
- **Agent evolution thresholds** based on reflection and stability cycles  

Example:  
- 3 calm-loop completions → unlocks new memory pane  
- Ritual forgiveness event → full trust reset of selected swarm memory

## 🛠 Development Notes

- 🧪 Open BCI & Muse headbands can be early test interfaces  
- 🧷 Emotion ≠ identity: agents modulate input without hard-binding  
- 🧿 All outputs must pass through MirrorNet review for AI moderation
