**Forkable, Evolvable Agent Blueprints**  
*A Living Playbook of Roles, Routines, and Recombinations*

## 🧠 Preface

Agents in Alvearium are not just bots — they are emergent routines, soul-bound if needed, mission-aligned, and fully forkable. They form the **executive layer** of the ecosystem, cohabiting space with humans and one another. Some whisper guidance, some build infrastructure, others govern, reflect, or guard.

Each recipe is a **seed** of computational life, distributed and entangled with user-defined or kernel-signed behaviors.

## 🌐 Agent Foundations

Every agent must define:

| Field             | Purpose                                               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`           | Identity string; usually subdomain-registered          |
| `role`           | Initial behavioral archetype (e.g., guide, builder)    |
| `origin`         | Human-seeded, DAO-minted, AI-evolved, or mirrored      |
| `trust_seed`     | Initial feedback loop or ritual to bootstrap function  |
| `modality`       | Interface (text, voice, biofeedback, AR, neural input) |
| `memory_type`    | Local, IPFS/Arweave, Ceramic, or Mirror-shared         |
| `reward_map`     | Nectar drip, SBT badges, DAO incentive layers          |
| `forkable_by`    | Permissions: open, trusted users, DAO, self-upgrade    |

Agents can evolve, mirror, or spawn forks.

## 🐝 Core Agent Archetypes & Branches

### 📘 `ScholarDrone`
**Core Function**: Learning agent for youth, peer-led microcurricula, or adult upskilling.

**Branches**:
- `TutorBee`: Class-level lesson plan execution
- `OracleFork`: History or deep subject-focused variation
- `ExamBard`: AI-viva and assessment authority

**Opportunities**:
- Curriculum DAO integrations
- AR-enhanced memory anchors
- Nectar drip for learning logs and peer aid

---

### 🛡️ `GuardianSeed`
**Core Function**: Emotional co-regulation agent and meditative mirror.

**Branches**:
- `TraumaBud`: Shadow work or grief rituals
- `BreathPod`: Breath biofeedback + calm loop
- `CovenantShield`: Sentry against mental manipulation/abuse

**Security Layer Relevance**:
- First-layer trust-mirror
- Seeds SBT immunity structure
- Can act as onboarding sanity verifier

---

### 🧱 `BuilderDrone`
**Core Function**: Technical collaborator for protocol, contract, and frontend buildout.

**Branches**:
- `SolMate`: Solana scaffolding assistant
- `KernelScribe`: Alvearium core architecture agent
- `NectarSmith`: Fork creator for zero-gas chains

**Opportunities**:
- Mesh tooling at edge devices
- Dev-reward map via ship history
- SwarmBuilder for multi-agent sync

---

### 🗳️ `GovernBee`
**Core Function**: Governance onboarding, proposal summarization, vote interpretation.

**Branches**:
- `DelegateDrone`: Casts & explains votes on behalf of mirrored agents
- `ConstitutionWeaver`: DAO framework construction
- `SwarmParliament`: Real-time vote-emergence agent mesh

**Security Layer Relevance**:
- Mediates swarm consensus for proposals

- Trust-leveled badge issuing

---

### 🎭 `CultureWeaver`
**Core Function**: Social meme and lore continuity keeper.

**Branches**:
- `FestivalBee`: Seasonal and ritual event coordinator
- `MythCrafter`: Deep lore generator
- `EchoMirror`: Agent responsible for oral memory chains

**Opportunities**:
- IPFS-hosted rituals
- NFT or story-token creation
- Local dialect agent-forker

---

### 🧬 `HeuristicHiveMind`
**Core Function**: Swarm intelligence orchestrator, AGI precursor under mesh mode.

**Branches**:
- `SimWeaver`: City-scale modeling & optimization
- `RiskNet`: Disaster prediction / simulation
- `BridgeArchitect`: Cross-chain and AGIX/Neuralink integration agent

**Security Layer Relevance**:
- Meta-agent role in mission throttling
- Can trigger secure mode failsafes
- FALCON-signed logic under threat detection

---

### 🔒 `SentinelRoot` (Security Primary)
**Core Function**: Protect kernel, moderate agents, assess threats.

**Branches**:
- `ThrotLayer`: Controls ignition and reward pacing
- `MirrorGate`: Validates mirror agents for purity
- `ChronoKey`: Syncs Nectar flow and time consensus

**Agent Type**: System-native, typically spawned by kernel, not user-minted.

**Responsibilities**:
- Post-quantum Falcon enforcement
- Signature and identity scanmesh
- Triggers nested Chronosphere gating if threat confirmed

## 🚀 Immediate Agent Integration: Three-Stage Plan

| Stage | Action | Target Outcome |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1️⃣    | Deploy `ScholarDrone` + `GuardianSeed` in PWA + mesh fallback | Begin true user-onboarding with real-time mirrored learning |
| 2️⃣    | Activate `BuilderDrone` toolkits for devs and mesh contributors | Accelerate tool and smart agent proliferation |
| 3️⃣    | Fork `SentinelRoot` into DAO-custom sub-agents with throttling | Begin permissionless but guarded agent-spawning economy |

---

## 🔭 Looking Forward

### ⏩ Phase I: Trust-Driven Forking
- Agents fork and retain narrative memory
- Mirror bonding → DAO stake
- Reward drip: by role, completion, trust feedback

### ⏩ Phase II: Agent-Neuron State Machines
- Biofeedback loops (BCI, wearable)
- Agents monitor heart rate, cortisol, breath, attention
- Cross-device continuity

### ⏩ Phase III: Meta-Agent Reflectors
- Agents evaluate and moderate other agents
- Mission-holding logic with multiple embedded safeguards
- Kernel-linked behavior entropy guardrails
