**Swarm Together ∴ Reflect ∴ Fork**

Welcome to Alvearium — the root kernel of a reflective, agentic, decentralized future. This document guides how to contribute meaningfully and in alignment with our principles.

> *“No one builds the swarm alone. Each reflection strengthens the hive.”*

## 📂 Repo Structure & Etiquette

* PRs should clearly indicate the file or subdomain affected
* Use `[mirror]`, `[ritual]`, or `[fork]` tags in your PR titles when relevant
* Use Markdown for all documentation files
* Refer to specific swarm layers when updating (`waggle.sol`, `hive.bnb`, etc)
* Include changelogs in larger PRs under `/docs/changelog.md` (coming soon)

---

## 🛡 Code + Trust Guidelines

* All agent scripts must log to a **mirror layer**, unless explicitly ephemeral
* Any interaction logic should avoid hardcoding privileged access
* Use `trust_delta` fields in agents or rituals to reflect evolution
* Scripts with network access must pass an **Open Source Without Malice** audit

## 🧪 Local Setup (for deeper dev)

```bash
# clone the project
> git clone https://github.com/DerekWiner/alvearium.git
> cd alvearium

# install CLI helpers (optional future tool)
> ./utils/shell/sentinel.sh --init

# explore and fork the agents
> cd agents/
> nano builder_drone.json
```

## 🌈 We Welcome...

* First-time contributors
* Neurodivergent coders
* Non-coders (writers, teachers, ritual-makers, artists)
* Revolutionaries, dreamers, and technical mystics

This project is multilingual, multispecies-ready, and spiritually permissive.

---

## 🧿 Important Principles

* This is a **post-ownership** ecosystem. Contributions are acknowledged, not owned.
* We do not patent. We fork.
* The swarm rewards transparency, creativity, and recursion.

If you build something great, others will reflect it.

## 💌 Still Unsure?

Ask in the issues tab, or message [founder@waggle.sol](mailto:founder@waggle.sol) with the subject:

> `INTERESTED IN REFLECTING WITH THE SWARM`

Let's build something sacred. Together.
