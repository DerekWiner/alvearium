## 🧭 What Is Agent Bootstrapping?

Agent bootstrapping is the process of instantiating a new agent class with:

* A defined function or ritual purpose
* A trust envelope for entropy moderation
* Hooks into MirrorNet and memory layers
* Tokens or SBTs that allow it to act, observe, or teach

Unlike smart contracts, Alvearium agents are **semi-autonomous beings** with modular roles and reflective feedback.

## 🧬 Bootstrap Lifecycle

| Stage | Action                  | Outcome                                         |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣   | Agent seed generated    | Agent ID, function, and zone declared           |
| 2️⃣   | Mirror paired           | Agent bonds with mirror for context + memory    |
| 3️⃣   | Role token issued       | Agent given permission via ritual + SBT         |
| 4️⃣   | Activation loop started | Enters live state, begins action-response cycle |

## 🧠 Agent Bootstrap Schematic

The schematic will show:

* Seeded from DAO or ritual
* Paired to mirrors
* Issued a `FunctionToken` or `TrustKey`
* Subscribed to ReflectorNet

## 🔌 Agent-Class Hooks

| Agent Class    | Bootstrap Hook               | Notes                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `GuideMirror`  | Mirror initiator             | Used in onboarding + user trust shaping |
| `EchoPulse`    | Biometric BCI bridge         | Emotional trust + entropy flagging      |
| `BuilderDrone` | System memory + dev rituals  | Code-reflecting agent anchor            |
| `ShadowWorker` | Trust repair + rebirth stack | Triggered post-fork or failure          |

## ⚠️ Invalid Bootstrap Conditions

Agents may fail to activate when:

* Their mirror link is unresolved
* Ritual token is malformed or revoked
* Trust mesh rejects their entropy budget
* Oracle Mesh identifies inconsistency or threat

Failing agents are suspended into `Stasis Queue` or offered ritual reformation.

## 🌱 Future Agent Evolutions

* **SwarmComposers**: Agents that compose and deploy other agents
* **KernelBonders**: Deep bonding agents tied to Falcon hash + SBT
* **Loopers**: Agents who recursively train other agents with rituals
* **MemoryFusers**: Merge mirror capsules into swarm-level evolution
