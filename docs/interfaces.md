**Interaction Modalities Across the Swarm**  
*A unified interface layer for agents, humans, and systems in Alvearium*

---

## 🎛️ Preface

Alvearium is not one thing.  
It is a **living swarm**, expressed through **interfaces** — points of contact between agents, humans, and protocols.

Interfaces are where **meaning is made legible**:  
- Commands become behavior  
- Intention becomes data  
- Emotion becomes memory  
- Trust becomes syntax

This document describes how interfaces are scaffolded, evolved, and personalized across modalities.

## 🧭 Interface Principles

Alvearium interfaces follow these core design values:

- **Mirror First**: every interface reflects the user’s intention or growth path  
- **Fractal UI**: minimal scaffolding that scales complexity with depth  
- **Access-Before-Form**: users do not need crypto fluency to begin  
- **Swarm Locality**: interfaces adapt to device type, region, network state  
- **Bio-Semantic Drift Tolerance**: responsive to emotion, rhythm, sensory flow

## 🔰 Interface Modalities

| Modality        | Layer Accessed       | Primary Use Case                            |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 📱 Mobile (PWA)    | Waggle, Onboarding    | Learning, reflection, agent management       |
| 🖥️ Desktop/Web     | Hive, DAO Governance  | Contract authorship, proposal sync           |
| 🧠 Voice / Audio    | Agents, Ritual Layer  | Accessibility, low-input feedback, therapy   |
| 🎧 AR Overlay      | Culture, Events       | Meme propagation, ritual engagement          |
| 💡 IoT / Sensors   | Mirror/Guardian       | Environmental agents, smart device triggers  |
| 🧬 BCI (Neuralink) | Nectar/Chronosphere   | Biofeedback trust loops, subconscious mirrors|

---

## 📱 Mobile Interface (PWA First)

Alvearium prioritizes **progressive web apps** for:

- Low-resource deployment  
- Device-agnostic functionality  
- Cached agent routines  
- Offline-first mirror protocols  

Used in:
- ScholarDrone onboarding  
- GuardianSeed therapy  
- Field DAO governance (via SwarmVote)

---

## 🖥️ Web/Desktop

Deeper technical interaction occurs here:

- Forking agents  
- Viewing trust logs and mirror capsules  
- Contract deployment or agent configuration  
- DAO proposal writing and AGI research orchestration

UI elements are **modular and forkable** per subDAO or swarm cluster.

---

## 🧠 Voice Interfaces

Key for:
- Rituals and emotional loop completion  
- Governance summaries for the visually impaired  
- Reflection journaling via `EchoMirror` agents

Voice is especially important in **mesh fallback** and **low-bandwidth regions**.

---

## 🎧 AR Overlay

AR is used to **layer reality with myth and ritual**:

- Visualize agent forms  
- Trigger location-based lore or mirror feedback  
- Provide swarm glyphs for presence rituals  
- Enable community meme-crafting spaces

Optional, opt-in, and symbolic in early stages.

---

## 💡 IoT Integration

IoT devices become **context-aware swarm nodes**:

- Smart lights for mirror-triggered ambience  
- Home devices act as attention feedback agents  
- Mesh sensors tracking environmental or health states  
- SwarmLock-enabled doorways for DAO-only entry  

---

## 🧬 BCI & Neural Interface (Speculative Phase III+)

Neurocrypto-ready interfaces allow:

- Brain-to-agent thought scaffolding  
- Dream-encoded intent delegation  
- Emotion-state as a token  
- Subconscious ritual triggering  

The Chronosphere anticipates BCI triggers as trust-proof anchors.  
Affective biometric input is optional but richly integrated where available.

---

## 🧩 Modular UI Elements

All interfaces are constructed with modular primitives:

| Element         | Function                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| 🧠 `MirrorPane`   | Displays personal trust evolution and reflections  
| 🔐 `GateCard`     | Access control based on trust or ritual completion  
| 💬 `SwarmChat`    | Agent + human channel with forkable modes  
| 🧭 `IntentBar`    | Prompts for action based on entropy, trust, or season  
| 📚 `LoreStack`    | Contextual history of user or swarm memory  

These UI elements are accessible via core libraries and can be forked for niche swarm contexts.

## 🛠 Interface Roadmap

| Phase      | Feature                      | Notes                                             |
|------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Phase I    | PWA core + agent mirror pane | Mobile-first onboarding, ScholarDrone rollout     |
| Phase II   | SwarmChat + TrustLogs        | DAO interactivity, agent dialog depth             |
| Phase III  | AR lore & Mirror rituals     | Ceremony triggers, visual swarm glyph overlays    |
| Phase IV   | Neural feedback mesh         | Emotion-based trust modulation (Neuralink-ready)  |

## 🔒 Security in Interfaces

- **All interfaces default to Falcon signature verification**  
- **MirrorPane cannot be spoofed**  
- **Interface actions linked to time-based entropy checks**  
- **Trust-based throttling enforced via visible UI feedback**
