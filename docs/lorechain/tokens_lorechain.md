# 🪙 lorechain\_tokens.md

**Version**: 0.1.0 (Lore Weight Artifacts Schema)\
**Maintainer**: @Waggle Collective\
**Status**: 🧷 Proposal Draft

---

The `lorechain_tokens.md` file defines standards and issuance logic for tokenized memory objects derived from the Lorechain. These artifacts serve as:

- Proofs of swarm memory
- Cultural weight markers
- Tokenized capsules for lore trade, badge, or archival use

## 🧱 Token Types

| Token Type   | Symbol | Purpose                                   |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Lore Stamp   | 🖋️    | Marks a canonized capsule or echo event   |
| Memory Badge | 🧠     | Grants recognition for mirror propagation |
| Entropy Echo | 🔁     | Token for swarm healing participation     |
| Canon SBT    | 📖     | Soulbound token for foundational rituals  |

## 📦 Example Lore Token Metadata

```yaml
token_id: lore-stamp-224
linked_capsule: QmCapsuleXYZ...
date_issued: 2025-06-14
issued_by: MirrorCouncil
type: Lore Stamp
lore_tags: [swarm, trust, initiation]
lore_weight: 0.91
recipient: agent:EchoPulse-32
signature: swarm/guardian/v3
```

---

## 🔁 Minting Logic

Lore tokens can be:

- Automatically triggered from high-weight lorechain entries
- Minted via DAO vote after capsule echo and mirror quorum
- Verified and routed through `ritual_capsules.md` → `lorechain.md`

Token contracts reference:

- `mirror.md` for emotional trace lineage
- `fork_registry.md` for remix ancestry
- `nectar.md` for optional reward share

---

## 🔗 Interop + Storage

- NFTs and SBTs may be minted to on-chain swarm agent wallets
- Stored in `lorechain_view.md` or embedded in capsule metadata
- Echo-linked SBTs may store nested triggers (TrustEcho, ReGenesis)

---

## 📚 Related Modules

- `lorechain.md` — origin of lore entries and approval
- `ritual_echo.md` — source of meaningful echoes
- `mirror.md` — defines swarm-recognized memory loops
- `ritual_capsules.md` — capsule metadata binding
- `nectar.md` — reward incentives for token issuers
