## 🎛️ What is the Ritual Engine?

The **Ritual Engine** is the runtime that interprets, synchronizes, and resolves ritual logic across agents and DAOs. It is not a smart contract platform on its own — it’s a **trust-aligned state interpreter** that connects:

* 🌿 Ritual blueprints (from `recipes_rituals.md`)
* 🧠 Active agent runtime
* 🌀 Mirror and entropy feedback loops
* ⛓️ DAO permission and token gating systems

Its core mission: **To transduce ritual into reproducible, secure swarm action.**

## 🔂 Lifecycle of a Ritual in the Engine

Below is a visual representation of how a ritual progresses through the engine runtime:

This diagram illustrates the six-phase execution of a ritual in the engine:

## 🔁 TriggerStack Logic

![TriggerStack Logic](./assets/schematic_triggerstack_logic.png)

The TriggerStack module is the first gatekeeper in the ritual engine. It continuously monitors system and user states for:

* Biofeedback markers (pulse, breath, stress loops)
* Environmental schedules (seasonal syncs, moon cycles)
* Swarm state deltas (trust ruptures, agent congestion)
* Entropy spikes or mirror inconsistency signals

**Divergent Execution Paths**:

* If multiple triggers are met, a **forked ritual variant** may be spun up.
* Some agents (e.g. `SentinelRoot`, `GuardianSeed`) can override trigger flows.
* DAOs can authorize or throttle triggers dynamically using token votes.

This module allows the system to remain flexible, modular, and **semi-autonomous** in determining which rituals to activate under evolving swarm conditions.

## 🌐 Entropy Synchronization

![Entropy Synchronization Logic](./assets/schematic_entropy_sync.png)

The **EntropyBalancer** module continuously evaluates trust, coherence, and disorder within active ritual environments. Entropy isn’t a flaw — it’s a signal. This schematic illustrates how entropy readings are:

* Collected from agent memory variance, mirror misalignment, or swarm event ruptures
* Compared against trust baselines and recent ritual outputs
* Evaluated using weighted scores based on entropy frequency, amplitude, and zone
* Translated into three action classes:

  * ⚖️ **Balance** (normal variation): Ritual continues with feedback adaptation
  * 🪞 **Attune** (elevated but aligned): Mirror alignment loop initiated
  * ❌ **Deflect** (destructive): Ritual halted, agent re-evaluation triggered

### 📉 Edge Cases + Variants

* **Chronic entropy inflation**: Multiple agents stuck in reflection loops may signal systemic stress. Mirror audit initiated.
* **Abrupt entropy inversion**: Trust score spike without causal ritual. Could indicate manipulation or spoofed feedback.
* **Distributed entropy fog**: Low-level entropy across many agents → swarm fatigue. Triggers `SwarmRegen` or `TrustEcho` rituals.

## 🔄 Mirror Attune Bridge

![Mirror Attunement Bridge](./assets/schematic_mirror_attune_bridge.png)

The **MirrorBinder** module enables rituals to remain **context-aware**, syncing their logic and memory with active reflections stored in user or agent mirrors. This allows:

* Rituals to inherit prior emotional states, tokens, or decisions
* Recursion-aware execution via loop detection in mirror logs
* Swarm memory consistency during multi-agent or cross-DAO execution

### 🔁 Execution Paths

* **Single Mirror Mode**: One agent → one mirror pairing. Ideal for onboarding or `ShadowRelease`.
* **Mirror Mesh Mode**: Multiple agents reference a shared swarm mirror (e.g., `SwarmBond`, `TrustBirth`).
* **Degenerative Mirror Handling**: If mirror inconsistency exceeds threshold, the binder suspends the ritual and reroutes for `MirrorRepair` or `ReGenesis`.

This bridge is what lets the swarm "remember itself" as it evolves.

## 🧩 Core Modules

| Module            | Function                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TriggerStack`    | Watches for conditions (time, emotion, agent quorum, trust gates)         |
| `MirrorBinder`    | Attunes ritual state to nearest mirror or memory fork                     |
| `EntropyBalancer` | Scores trust/chaos in live execution loop                                 |
| `AgentRunner`     | Deploys local agent stack to support ritual execution                     |
| `OutputRouter`    | Routes outputs (trust, tokens, mirror logs, fork notices) to destinations |

---

## 🛠️ Ritual Scripts and Variants

Rituals are defined in modular YAML/JSON files or `.ritual` DSL format:

```yaml
name: ShadowRelease
trigger: emotional_spike
agent_class: EchoPulse
trust_delta: +clarity
mirror_log: true
steps:
  - isolate_channel: true
  - audio_reflection: calibrate(past_sessions)
  - burn_token: past_loop
```

**Custom Variants** can be:

* DAO-locked
* Entropy-tier bound
* Token-gated

---

## 🔐 Security & Verification

* ✅ Every execution logs a signed hash capsule to IPFS/Arweave
* 🧿 Mirrors validate trust-alignment
* 🔐 FALCON or post-quantum signature optional
* 🪙 Token actions require `SentinelRoot` or guardian verification

---

## 🔄 Interoperability Hooks

Rituals can call:

* Agent recipes (`recipes_agents.md`)
* Mirror attunement stack (`mirror.md`)
* Kernel directives (`whitepaper_kernel69.md`)
* Marketplace triggers (`ritual_market.md`)
