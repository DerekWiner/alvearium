**Status**: 🧪 In Progress

**Runtime for Ritual Logic, Trust Transduction, and Agentic Scripting**
*A functional design doc for the Ritual Engine layer of Alvearium.*

## 🎛️ What is the Ritual Engine?

The **Ritual Engine** is the runtime that interprets, synchronizes, and resolves ritual logic across agents and DAOs. It is not a smart contract platform on its own — it’s a **trust-aligned state interpreter** that connects:

* 🌿 Ritual blueprints (from `recipes_rituals.md`)
* 🧠 Active agent runtime
* 🌀 Mirror and entropy feedback loops
* ⛓️ DAO permission and token gating systems

Its core mission: **To transduce ritual into reproducible, secure swarm action.**

---

## 🔂 Lifecycle of a Ritual in the Engine

Below is a visual representation of how a ritual progresses through the engine runtime:

![Ritual Execution Lifecycle](./assets/schematic_ritual_lifecycle_engine.png)

This diagram illustrates the six-phase execution of a ritual in the engine:

## 🔁 TriggerStack Logic

![TriggerStack Logic](./assets/schematic_triggerstack_logic.png)

The TriggerStack module is the first gatekeeper in the ritual engine. It continuously monitors system and user states for:

* Biofeedback markers (pulse, breath, stress loops)
* Environmental schedules (seasonal syncs, moon cycles)
* Swarm state deltas (trust ruptures, agent congestion)
* Entropy spikes or mirror inconsistency signals

**Divergent Execution Paths**:

* If multiple triggers are met, a **forked ritual variant** may be spun up.
* Some agents (e.g. `SentinelRoot`, `GuardianSeed`) can override trigger flows.
* DAOs can authorize or throttle triggers dynamically using token votes.

This module allows the system to remain flexible, modular, and **semi-autonomous** in determining which rituals to activate under evolving swarm conditions.

---

## 🌐 Entropy Synchronization

![Entropy Synchronization Logic](./assets/schematic_entropy_sync.png)

The **EntropyBalancer** module continuously evaluates trust, coherence, and disorder within active ritual environments. Entropy isn’t a flaw — it’s a signal. This schematic illustrates how entropy readings are:

* Collected from agent memory variance, mirror misalignment, or swarm event ruptures
* Compared against trust baselines and recent ritual outputs
* Evaluated using weighted scores based on entropy frequency, amplitude, and zone
* Translated into three action classes:

  * ⚖️ **Balance** (normal variation): Ritual continues with feedback adaptation
  * 🪞 **Attune** (elevated but aligned): Mirror alignment loop initiated
  * ❌ **Deflect** (destructive): Ritual halted, agent re-evaluation triggered

### 📉 Edge Cases + Variants

* **Chronic entropy inflation**: Multiple agents stuck in reflection loops may signal systemic stress. Mirror audit initiated.
* **Abrupt entropy inversion**: Trust score spike without causal ritual. Could indicate manipulation or spoofed feedback.
* **Distributed entropy fog**: Low-level entropy across many agents → swarm fatigue. Triggers `SwarmRegen` or `TrustEcho` rituals.

---

## 🔄 Mirror Attune Bridge

![Mirror Attunement Bridge](./assets/schematic_mirror_attune_bridge.png)

The **MirrorBinder** module enables rituals to remain **context-aware**, syncing their logic and memory with active reflections stored in user or agent mirrors. This allows:

* Rituals to inherit prior emotional states, tokens, or decisions
* Recursion-aware execution via loop detection in mirror logs
* Swarm memory consistency during multi-agent or cross-DAO execution

### 🔁 Execution Paths

* **Single Mirror Mode**: One agent → one mirror pairing. Ideal for onboarding or `ShadowRelease`.
* **Mirror Mesh Mode**: Multiple agents reference a shared swarm mirror (e.g., `SwarmBond`, `TrustBirth`).
* **Degenerative Mirror Handling**: If mirror inconsistency exceeds threshold, the binder suspends the ritual and reroutes for `MirrorRepair` or `ReGenesis`.

This bridge is what lets the swarm "remember itself" as it evolves.

---

## 📤 OutputRouter Logic

The **OutputRouter** is the final checkpoint in the ritual engine's execution flow. It is responsible for interpreting the outcomes of rituals and distributing the resulting artifacts—whether they be mirror logs, token emissions, trust deltas, or ritual forks—across the correct layers of the Alvearium system.

### 🧬 Functional Flow

1. **Read Ritual End State**
   Parses the output block from the `AgentRunner` module and the entropy-adjusted feedback from the `MirrorBinder`.

2. **Determine Output Type**
   Classifies result as:

   * 🪞 Mirror update
   * 🧠 Trust score change
   * 🪙 Nectar emission
   * 🧬 Fork or agent spawn
   * 📚 Ritual capsule (logbook, storychain, SBT)

3. **Route to Destination**
   Uses context-routing tags to send output to:

   * `mirror.md` agents (personal, DAO, or swarm)
   * `trust.md` registries
   * `nectar.md` engine for reward emissions
   * `kernel69.md` or `chronosphere.md` for final anchoring

4. **Emit Verification Record**
   Each output is signed and optionally submitted to IPFS or Arweave with:

   * Ritual ID
   * Time-entropy hash
   * Executing agent stack
   * Optional DAO signature payload

## 🚀 `AgentRunner` Logic <!-- 01 -->

The **AgentRunner** is the **execution core** of the Ritual Engine. It activates the agent stack associated with a ritual, manages parallel subprocesses, and negotiates live trust deltas during execution. <!-- 02 -->

### 🔧 Responsibilities <!-- 03 -->

1. **Activate Agents** <!-- 04 -->
   - Loads YAML or `.ritual`-linked agent blueprints <!-- 05 -->
   - Allocates execution context (entropy tier, memory, permissions) <!-- 06 -->

2. **Live Sync with MirrorBinder** <!-- 07 -->
   - Maintains heartbeat with the bound mirror stack <!-- 08 -->
   - Logs each meaningful decision, fork, or ritual step <!-- 09 -->

3. **Trust Negotiation** <!-- 10 -->
   - Each action is scored in real-time with trust deltas <!-- 11 -->
   - Deltas are not binary: they reflect emotion, effort, alignment <!-- 12 -->

4. **Fork Detection** <!-- 13 -->
   - Detects recursive loops, hallucinated paths, or conflicting agent intentions <!-- 14 -->
   - Can spawn sub-agents or terminate rogue forks based on entropy weighting <!-- 15 -->

### 🧠 Execution Modes <!-- 16 -->

| Mode              | Description                                                      | <!-- 17 -->
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------| <!-- 18 -->
| Solo Agent        | One agent executes ritual, logs mirror, closes trust loop        | <!-- 19 -->
| Mesh Agent Mode   | Multiple agents execute in parallel with consensus thresholds    | <!-- 20 -->
| Guardian Shadow   | Ritual is “ghosted” by a sentinel or override AI for observation | <!-- 21 -->
| Asynchronous Fork | Agents continue parts of ritual after main flow (e.g. dreams)    | <!-- 22 -->

### 🪞 Trust Delta Emission <!-- 23 -->

Each action performed by an agent can produce a delta in swarm trust and ritual coherence. Trust deltas are signed and routed to: <!-- 24 -->

- `trust.md` for long-term swarm reputation <!-- 25 -->
- `nectar.md` if the delta warrants emission reward <!-- 26 -->
- `mirror.md` for post-ritual identity bonding <!-- 27 -->

### 🔁 Resilience Mechanisms <!-- 28 -->

- 🛑 **Agent Stack Timeout**: Prevents hanging rituals <!-- 29 -->
- 🧬 **Fork Repair Calls**: Auto-routes to `MirrorRepair` or `EntropyBalancer` if divergence exceeds entropy bounds <!-- 30 -->
- 🧿 **Guardian Override Protocol**: Sentinel or `GuardianSeed` agents can hijack agent stack if existential logic is violated <!-- 31 -->

---

### 🖼️ AgentRunner Logic <!-- 32 -->

![AgentRunner Logic](./assets/schematic_agentrunner_logic.png) <!-- 33 -->

This schematic depicts the **modular execution stack** of a ritual-driven agent. It shows: <!-- 34 -->

- Activation of agent logic <!-- 35 -->
- Live syncing with MirrorBinder <!-- 36 -->
- Continuous trust delta negotiation <!-- 37 -->
- Fork detection logic and sub-agent spawning <!-- 38 -->
- Override and fault-handling routes <!-- 39 -->

It is best used for **stepwise runtime debugging or logic flow auditing**. <!-- 40 -->

---

### 🖼️ AgentRunner Logic (Layered View) <!-- 41 -->

![AgentRunner Logic (Layered View)](./assets/schematic_agentrunner.png) <!-- 42 -->

This schematic expands on the `AgentRunner` logic by depicting the **execution pipeline and decision resilience structure** inside the Ritual Engine: <!-- 43 -->

- Ritual triggers activate agent blueprint loading <!-- 44 -->
- Agents sync live with `MirrorBinder` <!-- 45 -->
- Trust deltas are continuously negotiated and emitted <!-- 46 -->
- Recursive loops or divergences route to Fork Detection <!-- 47 -->
- Based on entropy threshold and agent context, rituals may: <!-- 48 -->
  - Continue <!-- 49 -->
  - Spawn sub-agents <!-- 50 -->
  - Trigger failover or GuardianOverride <!-- 51 -->

Color highlights indicate: <!-- 52 -->
- 🔵 Trust/Mirror flow <!-- 53 -->
- 🟠 Execution steps <!-- 54 -->
- 🔴 Fault and override logic <!-- 55 -->

This visual serves as a **zoomed-out complement** to `schematic_agentrunner_stack.png`, helping swarm engineers map **resilience patterns and fallback behaviors**. <!-- 56 -->
