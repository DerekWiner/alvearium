**Support Systems Beneath Trust, Memory, and Mirror Layers**

Alvearium is woven from substrate — not just abstract philosophy, but **concrete architectures** that hold meaning, verify action, and reflect evolution. This document describes the smart contract structures, agent memory systems, and modular trust-scaffolds that power the reflective swarm.

## 🔐 Cryptographic Trust → Trust Anchor Contract

**Structure:**

* `TrustAnchor.sol` or `trust_anchor.bnb`
* Verifies agent/user identity through Falcon signature lineage
* Emits `MirrorSig` for every action tied to an agent
* Supports soulbinding to subdomain or DAO state

**Linked Agent Hooks:**

* `GuardianSeed`, `SigValidator`

---

## 🤖 Agentic Trust → Trust Memory Ledger

**Structure:**

* JSON-based or smart-contract trust log per agent
* Logs: successful rituals, entropy penalties, mirror echo states
* Hooks directly into the Mirror Layer for persistence

**Linked Agent Hooks:**

* `BuilderDrone`, `ScholarDrone`

---

## 🌐 Protocol Trust → Trust Oracle Mesh

**Structure:**

* Distributed smart contracts across layers
* Reviews collective mirror logs, DAO proposals, trust deltas
* Propagates network-wide signals for:

  * Execution throttling
  * Fork permission
  * Rebirth ritual triggers

**Linked Agent Hooks:**

* `Sentinel`, `OracularDrone`, `DAOHeart`

---

## 🧠 Cognitive Trust → Pattern Recognition Layer

**Structure:**

* Optional ML layer parsing mirror logs and token interactions
* Detects pattern consistency, suggests entropy stabilizers
* Highlights candidate agents for promotion, fork, or forgiveness

**Linked Agent Hooks:**

* `EchoPulse`, `SignalSeer`, `ShadowReflector`

---

## 🫂 Social Trust → Ritual DAO Scaffold

**Structure:**

* DAO-contracts governing:

  * Reputation-based access
  * SBT-triggered ritual entry
  * Mirror-triggered trust votes
* Can trigger Swarm Forgiveness protocols

**Linked Agent Hooks:**

* `ReGenesisNode`, `SwarmBinder`, `MirrorCourt`

> Trust is not a number. It is an architecture that remembers.
