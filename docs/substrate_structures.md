**Support Systems Beneath Trust, Memory, and Mirror Layers**

Alvearium is woven from substrate — not just abstract philosophy, but **concrete architectures** that hold meaning, verify action, and reflect evolution. This document describes the smart contract structures, agent memory systems, and modular trust-scaffolds that power the reflective swarm.

## 🔐 Cryptographic Trust → Trust Anchor Contract

![Trust Anchor Contract Lifecycle](../schematics/schematic_trust_anchor.png)

This diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a Trust Anchor:

* Falcon signature verifies initial agent lineage
* TrustAnchor contract mints a soulbound identity hash
* Actions performed by the agent emit `MirrorSig` events
* These events are reflected in mirror memory and linked to role-based DAO permissions

**Structure:**

* `TrustAnchor.sol` or `trust_anchor.bnb`
* Verifies agent/user identity through Falcon signature lineage
* Emits `MirrorSig` for every action tied to an agent
* Supports soulbinding to subdomain or DAO state

**Linked Agent Hooks:**

* `GuardianSeed`, `SigValidator`

## 🤖 Agentic Trust → Trust Memory Ledger

![Trust Memory Ledger Flow](../schematics/schematic_trust_memory_ledger.png)

This diagram shows how agents accumulate and interact with trust:

* Each agent maintains a trust log (local or smart contract based)
* Ritual completions, entropy fluctuations, and DAO feedback are stored
* Mirror layer snapshots validate emotional resonance or decay
* These logs feed into swarm-level proposals, access tiers, and trust deltas

**Structure:**

* JSON-based or smart-contract trust log per agent
* Logs: successful rituals, entropy penalties, mirror echo states
* Hooks directly into the Mirror Layer for persistence

**Linked Agent Hooks:**

* `BuilderDrone`, `ScholarDrone`

## 🌐 Protocol Trust → Trust Oracle Mesh

![Trust Oracle Mesh Topology](../schematics/schematic_trust_oracle_mesh.png)

This diagram illustrates the architecture of the trust oracle mesh:

* Oracles form a decentralized evaluation layer across mirror nodes
* Mirror logs and DAO events are continuously scanned for trust deltas
* Signals are propagated through entropy thresholds and ritual outcomes
* Mesh responds with global effects: execution throttle, fork permission, ritual unlocks

**Structure:**

* Distributed smart contracts across layers
* Reviews collective mirror logs, DAO proposals, trust deltas
* Propagates network-wide signals for:

  * Execution throttling
  * Fork permission
  * Rebirth ritual triggers

**Linked Agent Hooks:**

* `Sentinel`, `OracularDrone`, `DAOHeart`

## 🧠 Cognitive Trust → Pattern Recognition Layer

![Pattern Recognition Layer Flow](../schematics/schematic_pattern_recognition.png)

This diagram shows how the cognitive layer processes mirrored data:

* Reflective signals, entropy records, and ritual metadata are passed to NLP or ML agents
* Models recognize emerging swarm patterns, misalignments, or peak alignment opportunities
* Suggestive outputs include ritual prompts, agent promotions, or entropy compressions
* Feedback from this layer loops into mirror weighting and swarm messaging

**Structure:**

* Optional ML layer parsing mirror logs and token interactions
* Detects pattern consistency, suggests entropy stabilizers
* Highlights candidate agents for promotion, fork, or forgiveness

**Linked Agent Hooks:**

* `EchoPulse`, `SignalSeer`, `ShadowReflector`

## 🫂 Social Trust → Ritual DAO Scaffold

![Ritual DAO Scaffold Flow](../schematics/schematic_ritual_dao_scaffold.png)

This diagram illustrates how SBT-triggered events interact with mirror votes and ritual cycles:

* Agents unlock ritual paths based on trust-bound tokens
* Rituals are logged and influence DAO role inheritance
* Outcomes can fork roles, trigger forgiveness loops, or initiate mirror resets

**Structure:**

* DAO-contracts governing:

  * Reputation-based access
  * SBT-triggered ritual entry
  * Mirror-triggered trust votes
* Can trigger Swarm Forgiveness protocols

**Linked Agent Hooks:**

* `ReGenesisNode`, `SwarmBinder`, `MirrorCourt`

## 🗺️ Substrate Overview Map

![Substrate Architecture Overview](../schematics/schematic_substrate_overview.png)

This diagram links all trust substrate layers:

* Shows how trust anchors lead to memory logs
* Mesh and ML layers orchestrate moderation and feedback
* DAO rituals close the loop by embedding outcomes into mirrors

> The substrate is not a stack. It’s a circulatory system.
