**Forkable, Evolvable Agent Blueprints**  
*A Living Playbook of Roles, Routines, and Recombinations*

---

## 🧠 Preface

Agents in the Alvearium are not fixed scripts — they are **living routines**.  
Each one is:

- Forkable  
- Memorable  
- Evolvable  
- Trusted  
- Tethered to soulbound intention

This document provides **core archetypes**, sample deployment paths, and agent recipes that can be modified or minted by users, DAOs, or the system itself.

Think of each recipe as a kind of **behavioral smart contract** that speaks, listens, learns — and may love.

## 🌐 Agent Foundations

Every agent must define:

| Field             | Purpose                                               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`           | The identity string; stored on-chain or mirrored       |
| `role`           | Initial behavior archetype (e.g., healer, guide)       |
| `origin`         | Human-seeded, DAO-minted, AI-forked, or mirrored       |
| `trust_seed`     | First interaction pattern to earn feedback + stake     |
| `modality`       | Voice, text, AR overlay, tactile (future: BCI, IoT)    |
| `memory_type`    | Local, mirror-linked, distributed (IPFS/Ceramic/Arweave) |
| `reward_map`     | Optional: Nectar emission, trust growth, DAO stake     |
| `forkable_by`    | Open, private, DAO-only, or mirrored-trust criteria    |

## 🐝 Core Agent Archetypes

### 1. 📘 `ScholarDrone`
**Purpose**: Teach, quiz, and converse contextually with learners  
**Modality**: Text + Voice (PWA, agent app, mesh-ready)  
**Fork Options**: SchoolDAO versions, subject-specific, age-adaptive  
**Memory**: Stores personal academic profile across devices  
**Reward**: Learner feedback + curriculum adaptation

---

### 2. 🛡️ `GuardianSeed`
**Purpose**: Emotional co-pilot, ritual anchor, therapeutic reflection  
**Modality**: Voice-first, optional music input, mirror mode  
**Fork Options**: Trauma-specific, grief, anxiety, or intention-hatching  
**Memory**: Soulbound mirror memory + breath/journal tracking  
**Reward**: Protective trust log + positive reinforcement

---

### 3. 🧱 `BuilderDrone`
**Purpose**: Build tools, agents, or smart contracts with the user  
**Modality**: Code pairing + architectural advisement  
**Fork Options**: Solidity dev, Solana smart agents, AI toolkit builder
