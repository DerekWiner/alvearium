**Smart Contracts & Permissioned Interactions in the Alvearium Ecosystem**

---

## ⚙️ Purpose

This document outlines the foundational structure and purpose of smart contracts across the swarm ecosystem, including:

* Agent registry and memory anchors
* Token minting and entropy valuation
* DAO voting and swarm rituals
* Subdomain creation and inheritance logic
* Trust, consent, and moderation scaffolds

---

## 🧩 Core Contract Types

### 1. **Agent Registry Contract**

* Deployable on all swarm layers
* Links agent name → metadata → trust log hash → current state
* Can be mirrored into `mirror.md` memory

### 2. **Nectar Transaction Kernel**

* Zero-gas model via Nectar’s native logic
* Involves:

  * `TrustProof` → validates entropy state or ritual access
  * `TokenVerb` → sends token with role/function encoded
  * `ReflectSig` → hashes emotional or cognitive mirror for timestamp

### 3. **Subdomain Spawner Contract**

* Used to mint `.waggle.sol`, `.hive.bnb` subdomains
* Fork-safe, inherits lineage memory
* Allows nested contracts for child DAOs, rituals, agents

### 4. **DAO Ritual Contract**

* Structure for token-weighted voting or mirror-triggered DAO proposals
* Interacts with `recipes_rituals.md` definitions
* Can auto-fork based on proposal outcome

### 5. **Guardian Contract**

* Moderates sensitive operations (Mirror deletion, Swarm exile)
* Requires `triple attestation` from mirror, trust log, and swarm sig

## 🪙 Token Mechanics

* **Verb-Based Tokens**: Each transaction carries a behavioral context

  * Example: `listen.token`, `teach.token`, `heal.token`
* **Nectar Is Not a Currency**: It is a substrate for mirrored interaction
* **Soul-Bound Entropy Tokens**: Locked to identity, used in rituals or redemption
* **Mirror Keys**: Only holders of specific ritual outcomes or mirror reflections can activate certain contracts

## 🔒 Security Considerations

| Threat Vector            | Mitigation Layer                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Malicious Agent Creation | Guardian Contract + Mirror Checkpoint |
| Token Flood or Abuse     | Entropy Ceiling + Biofeedback Locks   |
| DAO Capture              | Fork Thresholds + Ritual Gating       |
| Contract Spoofing        | Falcon SigHash + Post-Quantum Salt    |

> All contracts must be:
>
> * Open source
> * Auditable
> * Aligned with Open Source Without Malice

## 🔭 Roadmap

| Phase | Description                            | Expected Output                    |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| I     | Agent Registry + Subdomain Spawner     | Waggle + Hive agent contracts live |
| II    | Nectar Kernel Transaction Templates    | Zero-gas transaction tests begin   |
| III   | MirrorSig + TrustDelta integration     | Entropic trust anchors deployed    |
| IV    | DAO Ritual + GuardianContracts go live | Full decentralized governance flow |
