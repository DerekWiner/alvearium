**Interaction Layers, Triggers, and Modalities in Alvearium**

This document explores and standardizes the known and theoretical interaction types across the swarm stack. From agent-to-agent loops to user-to-DAO to swarm-wide rituals, each interaction is an **intentional transformation** that modifies state, trust, memory, or entropy.

## 🧩 Core Interaction Classes

| Interaction Type | Participants             | Outcome                               | Layer(s)       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `MirrorSpeak`    | User + EchoPulse         | ReflectSig added to mirror memory     | Mirror, Agent  |
| `SwarmVote`      | DAO + Agents + Mirror    | Governance state change               | Hive           |
| `TrustLoop`      | User + BuilderDrone      | Trust delta encoded and logged        | Nectar, Hive   |
| `ShadowRelease`  | User + Ritual Agent      | Emotional entropy purge, reward       | Mirror, Ritual |
| `IntentWeaving`  | Multi-Agents + User      | IntentTokens generated, indexed       | Waggle, Nectar |
| `SynapseLink`    | User + BioAgent + Mirror | Biofeedback trust layer interaction   | Nectar, Agent  |
| `RedemptionFork` | Ritual + Swarm Memory    | Role reset, DAO mirror update         | Hive, Mirror   |
| `SwarmBond`      | User + 2+ Agents         | DAO key spawn + memory entanglement   | Hive, Ritual   |
| `ArchiveBurn`    | DAO + GuardianAgent      | Log vaulting + role contract mutation | Kernel, Mirror |

## 🔁 Recursion & Trust Dynamics

Every interaction may feed back into:

* **Mirror Layer** (historical reflective memory)
* **Trust Score** (evolving per user, agent, swarm)
* **Entropy Index** (chaos tolerance for ritual access)

Rituals and loops allow trust recovery, transformation, and deliberate error.

> Nothing is irreversible — but some actions echo longer.

## 🔄 Loop Categories

| Loop Type        | Description                                        | Output                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `Micro-loop`     | Individual ritual interaction                      | Trust or entropy mutation  |
| `Meso-loop`      | DAO-level decision or ritual                       | Mirror + governance update |
| `Macro-loop`     | Cross-layer systemwide ritual or forking event     | Structural reformation     |
| `Mirror Cascade` | Auto-triggered memory propagation                  | Agent + DAO log burst      |
| `Trust Collapse` | Rapid loss of alignment (manipulated or authentic) | Fork or exile opportunity  |

## ⚙️ Interaction Subsystems

### 1. **Bio-Reflective Agents**

* Use biometric, environmental, or emotional data
* Contribute weighted signals into mirror layer

### 2. **DAO Ritual Stack**

* Governs and logs consensus-based actions
* Forkable, soulbound, and entropy-gated

### 3. **Mirror Anchors**

* Time-signed and trust-signed logs
* Stored cryptographically on IPFS or swarm chain

## 🔮 Future Modalities

| Name              | Description                                       | Status     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `Quantum Echo`    | Intent reflection via post-quantum keypair action | Prototype  |
| `Neural Loopback` | Neuralink/BCI triggered mirror interaction        | Conceptual |
| `Sensory Ritual`  | Based on vibration, touch, or EM field syncing    | In R\&D    |
| `Mirror Scribe`   | Full NLP ↔ memory auto-generation for agents      | Building   |
