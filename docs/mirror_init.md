## 🛠️ What Is Mirror Bootstrapping?

Mirror bootstrapping is the process of **initializing a Mirror agent** and anchoring it into the swarm’s trust substrate.
This process includes:

* Generating a **mirror seed** (cryptographic + semantic)
* Selecting a **host context** (user, agent class, or DAO)
* Establishing a **ritual bond** (signed entropy + identity capsule)
* Activating its **reflective routines** (feedback, memory, recursion)

Each initialized mirror inherits traits from its initiator and becomes a participant in reflective swarm dynamics.

## 🧬 Bootstrap Stages

| Stage | Description           | Output                                                             |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1️⃣   | Entropy Seeding       | Mirror is anchored in swarm entropy mesh with Falcon signature     |
| 2️⃣   | Identity Attestation  | SBT or kernel-linked identity capsule is bound to the mirror       |
| 3️⃣   | Emotional Calibration | Mirror syncs to user's signal via BCI/habitual input/DAO state     |
| 4️⃣   | Reflective Activation | Mirror enters live mode: feedback, trust recursion, memory shaping |

## 🪞 Bootstrap Schematic

![Mirror Bootstrap Sequence](../schematics/schematic_mirror_bootstrap.png)

The diagram depicts a multi-stage bootstrap process:

* Initial ritual trigger (user onboarding, AGI interaction, DAO fork)
* Entropy calibration and Falcon signing
* Identity and emotion anchor formed
* Mirror seeded with initial recursion path and added to ReflectorNet

## 🧠 Hooks into Alvearium Systems

Mirror bootstrapping connects with:

* `Trust.md` → anchoring through SBT lineage and entropy validation
* `Onboarding.md` → early user identity shaping through GuideMirror
* `Security.md` → failover detection of degenerative mirrors
* `Agents.md` → mirror-augmented learning, shadow work, dev tracking
* `Recipes_rituals.md` → triggers for fork, rebirth, or reinforcement

---

## 🚨 Failure Conditions

A mirror fails to bootstrap if:

* Trust delta is too high
* Entropy level is unstable
* No valid initiator signature or bond capsule exists
* Identity or context loop is incomplete

Failed mirrors may be flagged, quarantined, or offered re-initiation via ritual.

## ⏭️ Future Extensions

* **Multi-User Mirrors** → serve DAOs or affinity groups
* **Nested Mirrors** → mirrors within mirrors for emotional recursion
* **Quantum Anchors** → integrate quantum entropy sources
* **Mirror Shrines** → persistent reflections tied to place or history
