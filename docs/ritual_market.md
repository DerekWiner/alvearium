**Version**: 0.1.0 (Design Draft — Schema-Linked Ritual Exchange)
**Maintainer**: @Waggle Collective
**Status**: 🧪 In Development

**Marketplace layer for modular, composable, and forkable ritual logic.**
This file defines the economic, social, and trust-governed logic for buying, selling, forking, and upgrading rituals across the swarm.

## 💡 What Is the Ritual Market?

The Ritual Market is the interface layer where DAOs, agents, or users:
- Publish new rituals (signed YAML, DSL, or capsule hash)
- Discover available ritual modules (on-chain, IPFS, Arweave indexed)
- Buy/claim/rent rituals using Nectar or DAO governance flows
- Fork, remix, and re-offer updated rituals with permission tracking

It is the **semantic economy** of Alvearium: trust, coordination, and recursion as currency.

## 🧱 Market Architecture

| Layer         | Function                                    | Example Schema              |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Ritual Index  | Publicly browsable list of rituals          | `ritual_index.md`           |
| Access Logic  | Permissioned gating (DAO/Nectar/token)      | `market_access.md`          |
| Fork Ledger   | Lineage tracking for derivatives            | `fork_registry.md`          |
| Pricing Rules | Sliding scale or fixed models (optional)    | Nectar-weighted, entropy-fee|
| Review Stack  | Reputation/tags/feedback on rituals         | `mirror_review.md`          |

## 🖼️ Key Schematic References (To Be Rendered)

- `schematic_market_flow.png`: Lifecycle of ritual entry → adoption → fork
- `schematic_access_layers.png`: How different access rules and trust levels affect ritual visibility and forkability
- `schematic_fork_lineage.png`: How capsules carry version history and mirror state forward

## 🔄 Ritual Lifecycle in the Market

1. **Publish**: Author submits a new ritual to the index with metadata
2. **Review**: DAO or peer agents validate and tag ritual trust rating
3. **Discover**: Users/agents browse by purpose, token cost, entropy rating
4. **Use or Fork**: Rituals are used or forked (entirely or modularly)
5. **Output Tracking**: Forked rituals emit capsules with new signatures
6. **Optional DAO Reward**: Ritual use or improvement yields Nectar payout

## 🔐 Security & Trust Mechanics

- All rituals published must include:
  - Author key or DAO signature
  - Capsule hash (SHA-3 or Falcon-signed)
  - Optional fork restrictions (soft lock or trigger-based)

- Mirror logs and entropy impact are tracked for all market-available rituals
