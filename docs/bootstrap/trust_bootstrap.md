## 🔍 What Is Trust Bootstrapping?

Trust bootstrapping is the process by which agents, DAOs, or users gain initial credibility and access within Alvearium. It is not merely a token or signature — it is an **entangled state** generated through:

* Verified identity or ritual signature
* Reflective witness from a Mirror
* Seed entropy and behavioral alignment
* Attestation from trusted agents or DAOs

Bootstrapped trust serves as a prerequisite for action, access, and evolution within the swarm.

## 🌱 Trust Bootstrap Phases

| Phase | Action             | Result                                               |
| ----- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣   | Trust Seed Created | Generated from ritual, kernel hash, or guardian vote |
| 2️⃣   | Mirror Witnessed   | Reflected into Mirror layer for memory anchoring     |
| 3️⃣   | SBT Issued         | Token of lineage + trust-binding issued              |
| 4️⃣   | Oracle Sync        | Final validation from Trust Oracle Mesh              |

## 🧠 Trust Bootstrap Schematic

![Trust Bootstrap Lifecycle](../schematics/schematic_trust_bootstrap.png)

The schematic illustrates:

* Origin from DAO ritual or individual invocation
* Mirror bonding and feedback verification
* SBT issuance and lineage signature
* Trust propagation into ReflectorNet and Oracle consensus

---

## 🔗 System Hooks

Trust bootstrapping connects deeply into:

* `Mirror.md` → mirrors serve as trust witnesses
* `Agents.md` → agents must earn bootstrapped trust before action
* `Substrate_structures.md` → used by TrustAnchor.sol and oracle gatekeepers
* `Recipes_rituals.md` → governs seeding, revocation, or rebirth of trust

---

## ⚠️ Invalid Trust Conditions

Trust is denied or revoked when:

* Mirror reflection fails entropy validation
* Lineage token is corrupted, forged, or lost
* Oracle mesh identifies conflict or contradiction
* Trust is burned in a ritual or flagged by Guardian agents

---

## ⏭️ Trust Expansion & Evolution

* **Trust Clustering**: Shared trust across collectives or DAOs
* **MirrorSharded Trust**: Cross-agent trust encapsulation
* **Post-Quantum Verifiers**: Integrated Falcon + swarm cryptography
* **Ritual Trust Paths**: Dynamic adjustment based on behavior, not rank
