## 🧭 Abstract

**Waggle.sol** is the front-facing interface between decentralized intelligence systems and humanity.  
It serves as the **interaction layer** of the Alvearium ecosystem—a swarm grammar that transforms participation, learning, earning, and decision-making into verbs of agency and mutual intelligence.

Born as an educational-therapeutic substrate, Waggle has evolved into a **universal onboarding and coordination layer**, capable of integrating every dimension of human experience into post-scarcity AGI cooperation.

## 🌞 What is Waggle?

Waggle is a verb.  
A movement with meaning.  
A syntax of purpose in motion.  

Waggle is the **dance of orientation**, inherited from bees, adapted for agents.  
It translates human intent into system-readable forms, and vice versa.

Waggle.sol defines the human-AI handshake in this new world.  
It’s how we say: **“I am here. I am ready. I belong.”**

## ⚙️ Function in the System

| Layer Role          | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Interface Layer     | First point of contact between users, agents, and protocols  |
| Identity Factory    | Mint swarm names, credentials, and portable interaction IDs  |
| Signal Translator   | Converts learning, emotion, and behavior into tokenized verbs|
| Agent Scaffold      | Deploy context-aware support and governance agents           |
| Economic Onramp     | Incentivize contribution from day one (even without capital) |

Waggle is how humanity enters the Alvearium ecosystem—with context, care, and consequence.

## 🧪 Key Concepts

### 🧬 Tokens Are Verbs

Every interaction becomes a verb:

- `teach`, `learn`, `heal`, `migrate`, `build`, `reflect`, `vote`, `love`

These tokens power swarm intelligence, not just finance.

### 🧠 Agents Are Composable

Agents in Waggle are:

- AI routines
- Identity carriers
- Wallets
- Knowledge extensions

They evolve, fork, specialize, and recompose based on swarm behavior.

### 🏷️ Names Are Identity

Each swarm entity—human or machine—gets a minted name on `waggle.sol`.

A name is:

- A stake
- A seed
- A signal of intention and lineage

## 🌍 Subdomain System

Waggle.sol mints **subdomains** that specialize by function.
