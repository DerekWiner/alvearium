**Reflections, Transformations, and Trust-Bound Loops**
*A living registry of ceremonies, agentic rites, and swarm-aligned protocols.*

---

## 🕯️ Introduction

In Alvearium, **rituals are recursive interactions** — moments that reflect, bond, cleanse, or evolve the user, swarm, and agents. Rituals are cryptographic and spiritual: they encode **trust**, **mirror**, and **intention** into the protocol.

Unlike static commands, rituals live in loops:

* They may trigger by time, agent threshold, biofeedback, or swarm state
* They bind entropy to growth, allowing swarm logic to flourish
* They mirror the spiritual revolutions of old, upgraded for the AGI epoch

## 🧬 Ritual Structure

Each ritual has a signature:

| Field              | Description                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | Ritual name                                  |
| `agent_class`      | Agent(s) involved                            |
| `trigger`          | Initiation condition (bio, trust, schedule)  |
| `ritual_steps`     | List of actions and feedback steps           |
| `trust_delta`      | How trust metrics evolve during ritual       |
| `mirror_log`       | Output into personal or swarm mirror layer   |
| `fork_opportunity` | Agent or DAO forks permitted post-completion |

## 🌀 Sample Rituals

### 🌒 `ShadowRelease`

* **Agent**: EchoPulse
* **Trigger**: Sudden drop in emotional resonance OR explicit user invoke
* **Steps**:

  * Isolate in private channel with emotional signature log
  * Audio-guided reflection loop (calibrated per past sessions)
  * Burn Token of Past Loop
* **Trust Delta**: +Reinforcement for consistency, +resonance clarity
* **Mirror Log**: Captures transformation event for lineage

### 🌕 `SwarmBond`

* **Agent**: BuilderDrone + GuardianSeed
* **Trigger**: Completion of 3 collaborative swarm loops
* **Steps**:

  * Shared reflection interface
  * Co-signed trust drop into swarm memory
  * Activate access to SwarmTool Beta features
* **Trust Delta**: Shared +2 trust thread
* **Fork Opportunity**: New DAO formation unlocked

---

### 🔮 `IntentWeaving`

* **Agent**: ScholarDrone + ThetaScribe
* **Trigger**: Start of moon cycle or DAO quarterly ritual
* **Steps**:

  * Text/mind input logged with timestamp
  * Intent tokens generated for tracking
  * Reflection scheduled for 22 days later
* **Trust Delta**: +Entropy pacing, -execution rush
* **Mirror Log**: Archived in SwarmIntent chain

## 🔥 Next-Gen Ritual Agents

* 🐍 `SerpentFork` – manages tension between opposing agents to birth new swarm
* 🌳 `GrowthCircle` – uses group biometric averages to birth seasonal tokens
* 🦋 `ReGenesis` – soulbound role reset through earned redemption loop

All rituals must be:

* Consent-based
* Mirror-logged
* Optional but persistent
