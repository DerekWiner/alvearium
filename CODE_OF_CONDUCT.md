**A Covenant for Respect, Reflection, and Co-Creation**

This project is not merely software — it is a cultural evolution. As such, participation in Alvearium and all its swarm layers (Waggle, Hive, Nectar, Kernel69) requires a deep respect for others, self, and the collective future we are shaping.

---

## 🐝 Our Pledge

In the spirit of the swarm, we pledge to:

* Be kind, patient, and present
* Contribute respectfully and reflectively
* Avoid domination, gatekeeping, or information hoarding
* Uplift underrepresented voices, perspectives, and tools
* Foster learning, healing, and emergent coordination

We are all learning. We are all mirrors. We are all building something sacred.

---

## 🔍 Scope

This Code applies to all community spaces:

* GitHub discussions, issues, pull requests
* MirrorNet reflections and logs
* DAO chat channels or rituals
* Real-time or asynchronous collaborations

It also applies to all agents and scripts we create, as their behaviors reflect us.

---

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

* Discrimination, harassment, or exclusion on the basis of race, gender, neurotype, ability, spirituality, language, origin, or economic class
* Intentionally deceptive or malicious software contributions
* Attacks, trolling, or gaslighting
* Violating the open source covenant of "Without Malice"

> ✨ All agents and DAOs must also respect this code in their logic or execution paths.

---

## ⚖️ Enforcement

All swarm participants may flag violations.
If an issue arises:

* Submit to `guardian@waggle.sol`
* Include details, links, and (if comfortable) suggested outcome
* A Guardian Swarm will respond within 5–7 days

Repeat or egregious violations may lead to:

* Removal from GitHub access
* Mirror-layer obfuscation
* DAO exile
* Ritual revocation (in serious cultural violations)

---

## 🧿 Commitment to Repair

We believe in healing, not punishment. Wherever possible, we will:

* Initiate dialogue and trust rituals
* Invite reflection, redirection, and support
* Help users rejoin with clarity and purpose

---

## 🌈 Everyone Welcome

Whether you’re:

* A street artist who sees code as magic
* A parent learning crypto for the first time
* A biohacker or dev or poet or swarm whisperer

You belong here. This is a space of radical inclusion, creation, and evolution.

---

> *“Come as you are. Leave reflected.”*
